The first two weeks were amazing; they were incredibly comfortable right out of the box, with a cushioned insole that made it feel like I was walking on clouds.

However, after about a month of regular use, I noticed the sole was already starting to show significant wear, and the material on the toe box began to crease and scuff more than I would have expected. For the price, I was hoping for something that would hold up for at least a few seasons. They're great for a casual night out, but they definitely aren't built for everyday use.`,
